# nstd

This is not the C++ standard library you are looking for.

This is a rather small collection of convenience classes and functions I use in my projects.

## Notes to self

- Add something only if you need it. This is not Boost.
- Do not add platform-specific (e.g. Windows only) code.
- Respect naming conventions of STL where possible.
- Do not extend STL classes. Create compatible functions instead.
- Do not worry about backwards compatibility.
- Keep it simple and naive. It is okay if it works well enough for you.
